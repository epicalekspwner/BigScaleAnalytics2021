### 🕵️ Project Description

<p align="justify"> 
  <strong>To improve one’s skills in a new foreign language, it is important to read texts in that language.</strong> But in order to make learning really effective, these text have to be at the reader’s language level. However, it is difficult to find texts that are close to someone’s knowledge level (A1 to C2).
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
  This project aims to build a model for English speakers that <strong>predicts the difficulty of a French written text</strong>. This can be then used, e.g., in a recommendation system, to recommend texts that are appropriate for someone’s language level. If someone is at A1 French level, it is inappropriate to present a text at B2 level, as she won’t be able to understand it. Ideally, a text should have many known words and may have a few words that are unknown so that the person can improve.

  This project is <strong>iterative</strong> and will be conducted in <strong>multiple milestones</strong> that are due throughout the semester:
</p>

- **Milestone 1** (due March 15) - Reading/Thinking & Gathering the data 
- **Milestone 2** (due April 13) - Creating/Evaluating the model
- **Milestone 3** (due May 10) - Iterate & Improve
